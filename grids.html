        "I was an EMT for many years befire I joined the bootcamp.
        I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
        shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
        gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
        at a VR startup."

         <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from
            their experience was easy.
        </h2>
        <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which
            I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
            neccessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
            as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
            You will get the personal attention you need form an incredible
            community of smart and amazing people."

        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. 
            I needed some stucture from professionals who can help me learn 
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the 
            program. They entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
            They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my 
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorails could ever have.
            In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example
            of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
